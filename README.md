# LibIEC61850-R-GOOSE

In this project, the LibIEC61850 was modified and it was implemented a Gateway Sender and a Gateway Receiver in order to send R-GOOSE over different ISPs. 
The code developed was used in the Msc Thesis "IEC 61850 Routable GOOSE and SV profiles over IP Telecom Networks" written by Diogo Saraiva as well as to write the paper "IEC 61850 Data Transfer Evaluation over Public Networks" published in WPMC 2019, Lisbon.
